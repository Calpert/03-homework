Description: Created a generate password site that creates a password based on certain criteria you would like.

I first created arrays for characters that the password will contain.
Then I wrote a function that takes the inputs from the user and takes potential characters pushing them into an array.
Then I wrote a function that randomizes the characters.
Then prompt user for inputs to create the password.
I created a for loop to allow answers/code to be executed repeatedly.
Collected all inputs and put them in an object and return that object.
Then we take the object created through function to return passwordSelections.
Then finally, added an event listener to generate the button.
